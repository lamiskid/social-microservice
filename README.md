- [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk21-archive-downloads.html)
  you can download the jdk directly from inteliJ.
  Go to settings->project Structure->SDK
  Then select JDK 17 or above


## Running the application locally

Go to the root of the base folder where the docker-compose.yml file is located
and run
```shell
